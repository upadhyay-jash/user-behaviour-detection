# user-behaviour-detection
This project develops a machine learning pipeline to classify user behavior as "active" or "inactive" based on their in-app interactions. By analyzing patterns in session duration, clicks, and device information, we can predict user engagement, which is crucial for personalization, user retention strategies, and business decision-making.
